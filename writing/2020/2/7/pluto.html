		<h4>Plutonic Disposition</h4>

  <h1>Plutonic Disposition</h1>

    <p>
    My father is the earth.<br />
    Moist loamy soil sinking under my roughened feet<br />
		Twigs tangled in wayward hair<br />
    Sweet sweet honey incubated by the dying bees<br />
		An imperfect cracked ruby flashing halfway in the sun.<br />
    <br />
    When I was little I played to the earth's steady, half woven beat<br />
    I didn't know it can only end with either a bang or a whimper.<br />
    (Did it already end with a whimper? Was the girl dancing on a black hole this entire time?)<br />
    <br />
    He is a dutiful provider, starved of the sea for so long that <br />
    He forgot the simple harmony of a school of fish.<br />
    <br />
    He gave me the X that made me but<br />
    Could not accept the woman that came from the ocean's womb<br />
    <br />
    An evergreen redwood patiently sheds its leaves<br />
    A generation feels its skin peel<br />
    His Gravity is so deeply within us<br />
    We all forget how to fly<br />
