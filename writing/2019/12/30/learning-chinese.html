<p>Imagine yourself as a 20 something, English native speaker, with a long term vision of speaking, writing, and painting Chinese for no particular reason. Imagine yourself as me, basically.</p>

<p>I have noticed that learning Chinese as someone of my demographic is intimidating and haphazard.</p>

<p>I have tried</p>
<ul>
  <li>a weekly in-person class</li>
  <li>several language learning apps, including Duolingo</li>
  <li>downloading Chinese keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>and have ended up</p>
<ul>
  <li>stopping showing around week 5 of 10</li>
  <li>deleting the apps after finding them too difficult or too easy. Duolingo was especially dramatic.</li>
  <li>keeping Chinese keyboard despite everything and the fact that it screws with emoji keyboard access</li>
</ul>

<p>What to do in my situation?</p>

<p>I actually don’t have an answer, but I’ll post another post when I do! #clickbait</p>

<p>Next on the to try list</p>
<ul>
  <li>picking up a 1000 Chinese word picture book from the library and start reading</li>
</ul>
